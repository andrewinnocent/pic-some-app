# Challenge

Make the image display the filled heart icon when it's already favorited

Logic to follow:
* If the image is favorited, display the filled heart icon always
* Otherwise, if the image being hovered on, display the heart outline instead
* If it isn't favorited OR hovered on, don't display anything

Remember to make it so clicking the filled heart icon ALSO runs the toggleFavorite function!

Filled heart icon:
<i className="ri-heart-fill favorite"></i>
