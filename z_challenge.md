# Challenge

1. Change the plus icon to a filled shopping cart icon when an image is already in the cart. This should display whether the image is being hovered or not (like the favorite icon).

Icon to use when item already in cart:
<i className="ri-shopping-cart-fill cart"></i>

2. Make it so clicking the little shopping cart icon on the image removes the item from the cart
