# Challenge

Add ability to toggle an image's `isFavorited` property by clicking the heart icon (filled heart doesn't need to display on the image yet)

1. Add a toggleFavorite method to context. It should take an `id` parameter and update the array of allPhotos by flipping the `isFavorited` property of the photo with the matching `id`
    a. Have this function also console.log something so we know it's running correctly
    b. Don't try to modify the individual image object only. Make sure to provide a whole new array to context with the one item with the matching `id` being changed.
2. Make it so clicking the heart icon on any given image runs this method
