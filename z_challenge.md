# Challenge

Set up the Context for our app.

1. In a new file, create a new context with React
2. In that same file, create a custom component that renders the Provider of the context you created
3. For now, just pass in an empty string "" as the context provider's value prop
4. Export the custom Provider component and the full context object (so we can pass it to the useContext hook eventually)
5. Set up your index.js to use the custom context Provider you created. (You can wrap it as a parent of the Router component)
